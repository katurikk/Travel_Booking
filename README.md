## 🧩 Tech Stack

* **Node.js** + **Express**
* **SQLite** (Development DB)
* **JWT** Authentication
* **Postman** for testing

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 🔐 Authentication

* `POST /api/auth/register` – Register user
* `POST /api/auth/login` – Login and receive JWT token

* `POST /api/flights/book` – Book a flight

### 🏨 Hotel APIs

* `GET /api/hotels/search` – Search hotels
* `POST /api/hotels/book` – Book hotel room

### 🧳 Holiday Packages

* `GET /api/packages/search` – Search packages
* `POST /api/packages/book` – Book a package

### 🧾 Booking Management

## 🧪 Sample User Login Payload

```json
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123"
}
```

---

## 🧠 Database Design Summary

### Key Tables

* `users` – User info
* `airlines`, `airports` – Static reference
* `flights`, `hotel_rooms`, `packages` – Searchable resources
* `flight_bookings`, `hotel_bookings`, `package_bookings` – Booking records
* `passengers` – Individual flight travelers
* `payments` – Linked to booking records

### Constraints Handled

* Foreign keys for bookings
* NOT NULL & UNIQUE where needed
* Price stored at time of booking

## 🧪 Postman Collection

All API endpoints are documented in the included Postman collection:

> ✅ Make sure to import `TravelBooking.postman_collection.json` for testing.

---

## 🔐 Security Features

* Password hashing with `bcryptjs`
* Token-based auth with `jsonwebtoken`
* Input validations
* Prevent overbooking (flight/hotel rooms)

---

## 📌 Assumptions

* Payment gateways are mocked
* Seasonal pricing and price alerts are optional
* Basic error handling and validation included

---

## ✅ Completed Scope

* ✅ Auth APIs
* ✅ Flight APIs (search & book)
* ✅ Hotel APIs (search & book)
* ✅ Package APIs (search & book)
* ✅ Booking management
* ✅ Payment APIs (mocked)
* ✅ Airports & City APIs
* ✅ JWT middleware
* ✅ Postman collection
* ✅ `.env` configuration

---

## ✨ Future Improvements

* Add admin panel for management
* Modify or reschedule bookings
* Integrate real payment gateway (e.g., Stripe)
* Add push notifications or email confirmations

## 📮 Submission

* GitHub repo ✅
* README with API Docs ✅
* Seed data (SQL) ✅
